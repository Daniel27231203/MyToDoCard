                I am working on this project to practice and improve my
                development skills. I find the process genuinely engaging and
                exciting because I am creating a complete full-stack project
                entirely on my own. As part of this work, I am using Prisma for
                efficient database management, with Supabase as the database
                solution. This project allows me to deepen my understanding of
                all aspects of development, from backend programming to database
                integration.
